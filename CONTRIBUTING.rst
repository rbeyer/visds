The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/rbeyer/visds/issues

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)


Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in CHANGELOG.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9, and optionally for PyPy.
   And make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.


What to expect
--------------

Our development of visds is not particularly continuous,
and it is entirely possible that when you submit a PR
(pull request), none of us will have the time to evaluate or integrate
your PR.  If we don't, we'll try and communicate that with you via the
PR.


visds People
---------------

- A visds **Contributor** is any individual creating or commenting
  on an issue or pull request.  Anyone who has authored a PR that was
  merged should be listed in the AUTHORS.rst file.

- A visds **Committer** is a subset of contributors, determined by the
  project lead.


Rules for Merging Pull Requests
-------------------------------

Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull
requests (PRs). This applies to all changes to documentation, code,
binary files, etc. Even long term committers must use pull requests.

In general, the submitter of a PR is responsible for making changes
to the PR. Any changes to the PR can be suggested by others in the
PR thread (or via PRs to the PR), but changes to the primary PR
should be made by the PR author (unless they indicate otherwise in
their comments). In order to merge a PR, it must satisfy these conditions:

1. Have one approval.
2. If the PR has been open for 2 days without approval or comment, then it
   may be merged without any approvals.

Consideration should also be given to weekends and other holiday
periods to ensure active committers all have reasonable time to
become involved in the discussion and review process if they wish.

In order to encourage involvement and review, we encourage at least
one explicit approval from committers that are not the PR author.

However, in order to keep development moving along with our low number of
active contributors, if a PR has been open for 2 days without comment, then
it could be committed without an approval.

The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no
committer has an objection, and the above requirements are
satisfied.

In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another
committer, all involved committers should seek to arrive at a
consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed by discussion,
compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed
change.
